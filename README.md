# What is ClojureDart?
ClojureDart is a recent Clojure dialect to make native mobile and desktop apps using Flutter and the Dart ecosystem.

It's production-ready: applications are being built with it.

# Funding and Support
Clojuredart is developed by [Baptiste Dupuch](https://github.com/dupuchba)[üê¶](https://twitter.com/BaptisteDupuch) and [Christophe Grand](https://github.com/cgrand)[üê¶](https://twitter.com/cgrand) by taking time off of their consultancy -- it's grueling at times.

How can you help?

* **Sponsor us** (individual sponsorship is nice but corporate sponshorship is great). You can sponsor any of us or both, it doesn't matter, we split ([:heart: Baptiste](https://github.com/sponsors/dupuchba)  [:heart: Christophe](https://github.com/sponsors/cgrand)).
* **Contract us** for assistance, training, consulting or dev (can be as mundane as requesting to port a clj/cljs lib to cljd)

# Cheatsheet

We have a [cheatsheet](doc/ClojureDart%20Cheatsheet.pdf) covering ClojureDart specifics on one side and Flutter programming on the other side.

# Conj 2023 talk and demo

Want to see what's the workflow like? Our talk at Clojure/Conj 2023 is mostly a live-coding session, starting from scratch and assuming no prior knowledge of Dart or Flutter! [Click here or on the image üëá](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqBeGpuedf0)

# Where to find help?
Stop by the [Clojurians #ClojureDart channel](https://clojurians.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=clojuredart) or open an issue.

# Completeness Status
The two missing big features are:
- no REPL yet (WIP), but we have excellent hot-reload during UI work to get instant feedback
- multi-method (WIP)

# Your first app!

Prerequisites: Clojure and Flutter installed and on your path.

Create a project directory with its `deps.edn`
``` shell
mkdir hello
cd hello
cat << EOF > deps.edn
{:paths ["src"] ; where your cljd files are
 :deps {tensegritics/clojuredart
        {:git/url "https://github.com/tensegritics/ClojureDart.git"
         :sha "6c1b1538310862dfe3fc3960fb897cf5de5a4b59"}}
 :aliases {:cljd {:main-opts ["-m" "cljd.build"]}}
 :cljd/opts {:kind :flutter
             :main acme.main}}
EOF
```

(To update an existing project to the latest ClojureDart, just do `clj -M:cljd upgrade`)

Initialize project:

``` shell
clj -M:cljd init
```

Add some source code:

``` shell
mkdir -p src/acme
cat << EOF > src/acme/main.cljd
(ns acme.main
  (:require ["package:flutter/material.dart" :as m]
            [cljd.flutter :as f]))

(defn main []
  (f/run
    (m/MaterialApp
      .title "Welcome to Flutter"
      .theme (m/ThemeData .primarySwatch m.Colors/pink))
    .home
    (m/Scaffold
      .appBar (m/AppBar
                .title (m/Text "Welcome to ClojureDart")))
    .body
    m/Center
    (m/Text "Let's get coding!"
       .style (m/TextStyle
                .color m.Colors/red
                .fontSize 32.0))))
EOF
```

Compile, watch and run:

```
clj -M:cljd flutter
```

In most environments this will spawn a desktop app.

More details [there](doc/flutter-quick-start.md)

# Quick starts

- [For Flutter](doc/flutter-quick-start.md) to build GUIs
- [For Plain Dart](doc/quick-start.md) to build CLI apps.

# Examples

In the [samples directory](samples/) directory, you'll find original sample code and ports of [Flutter recipes](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook).

## How to run a sample project

Clone the ClojureDart repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Tensegritics/ClojureDart.git
```

Go to the sample you want to try, let's say `fab`:

```shell
cd ClojureDart/samples/fab
```

Init the project:

```shell
clj -M:cljd init
```

Then launch the watcher:
```shell
clj -M:cljd flutter
```

You should get the sample running either in Chrome or as a desktop app.

To specify your exact target you must run `flutter devices` which outputs something like:

```shell
3 connected devices:
iPhone 6s (mobile) ‚Ä¢ D6707352-78D2-46BB-AB95-87355283FC82 ‚Ä¢ ios            ‚Ä¢
com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-15-5 (simulator)
macOS (desktop)    ‚Ä¢ macos                                ‚Ä¢ darwin-arm64   ‚Ä¢
macOS 12.4 21F79 darwin-arm
Chrome (web)       ‚Ä¢ chrome                               ‚Ä¢ web-javascript ‚Ä¢
Google Chrome 103.0.5060.114
```

The second column is the id of the target (here `D6707352-78D2-46BB-AB95-87355283FC82`, `macos` or `chrome`) that you pass to the watcher:

```shell
clj -M:cljd flutter -d D6707352-78D2-46BB-AB95-87355283FC82
```

Enjoy! üßÉ

# `cljd.flutter`
`cljd.flutter` is an utility namespace to remove Flutter boilerplate and integrate more nicely with Clojure.

# `cljd.flutter.alpha`

Deprecated, use `cljd.flutter`.

# `cljd.flutter.alpha2`

Got out of alpha status and lives a happy life as `cljd.flutter`.

# Thanks!

To all individuals who blindly believed in our endeavor and sponsored our work.

To NuBank who approached us very early for sponsorship.

To Roam Research who bet their mobile apps development (now in the App Store and Play Store) on ClojureDart and allowed us to make steady progress since Summer 2021.

If you want to sponsor our work, you can sponsor either of us, we'll balance sponsorship. If you are a company you can also contact us directly.
